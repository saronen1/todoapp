TO-DO App

A simple TO DO list application, which I created to practice JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
The application allows user to enter tasks which will be shown in a list, mark tasks done (which turns them green), and remove tasks.

I found inspiration and help for this project from https://codepen.io/JohnPaulFich/pen/MXmzzM. However, this app includes an additional feature
that allows the user to clear the list when all tasks are marked as done.
